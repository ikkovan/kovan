indicate commands -> $ (run commands on bash without the dollar sign)

# set the git identity

$ git config --global user.email "username@havelsan.com.tr"
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"


#Initializiton

1- Go into your project's local repository on your computer.
2- Cloning the repository: 
    $ git clone https://serkantan@bitbucket.org/hdyesilli/ikkovanstaj.git // the link varies user to user.
3- It prompts a user password.

#Show the current changes in the repo:

1- $ git status

#Update your local

0- Fetch the updates from the mainstream: 
    $ git pull 
1- Manipulate files, documents in your local repository folder.
2- If you want to add them to the local stream
    1.1 add specific file: 
        $ git add "file_name" // without exclamation marks.
    1.2 add all you got: 
        $ git add -A 
3- If you want to discard a previously added file: 
    $ git restore --staged "file_name"
4- If any file added and the changes in the local repository are to be sent to the mainstream.
    $ git commit -m "Description of the change."
5- Push changes to the mainstream without a pull request. (dangerous)
    $ git push -u origin master
6- Create a pull request (more details on pull requests see. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request)
    $ git checkout -b "branch-name" // a couple of details here: param -b is used to switch the branch.
    // now on the branch "branch-name"
    { go 2 }
    $ git commit -a -m "Add the first draft of some feature"
    $ git push origin "branch-name" // instead of the main branch of the project (master) we push it to the branch we just created. 
    // the process shall be like this: Someone in the team will review the code and decide upon merging the code to the master branch or
    // On the bitbucket/pull_requests page there can be discussions to elaborate with the update. The pull request might be discarded if it does not solve the problem or it has bugs many bugs Ewwwww
